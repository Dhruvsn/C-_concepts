        Basic of C++:-  

        1. C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, USA.
        2. C++ is a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of high-level and low-level language features.
        3. C++ is a compiled language, which means that the code written in C++ is translated into machine code by a compiler before it can be executed.
        4. C++ is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it allows developers to create classes and objects to represent real-world entities.
        5. C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms, allowing developers to choose the best approach for their needs.
`       6. C++ is a statically typed language, which means that the data types of variables must be declared before they can be used.
        7. C++ supports operator overloading, which allows developers to define custom behavior for operators when applied to user-defined types.
        8. C++ has a rich standard library that provides a wide range of functions and classes for common programming tasks, such as input/output, string manipulation, and data structures.
        9. C++ supports templates, which allow developers to create generic classes and functions that can work with any data type.
        10. C++ is widely used in system programming, game development, embedded systems, and high-performance applications.
        11. C++ is a powerful language that provides low-level memory manipulation capabilities, allowing developers to write efficient and high-performance code.
